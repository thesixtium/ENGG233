# ENGG233

## Description
This is a culmination of all my assignments in ENGG 233 at the University of Calgary.

### What It Does
These files do not do anything on their own, and are only examples of labs I submitted for ENGG 233.

### Technologies Used
Python3 and imported libraries are the only things used in this class.

## Installation
To run any of these files, Python3 is required. An IDE is also helpful as all files print information in terminal, but your computer's native terminal can also be used.

## Usage
Please do not sumbit any of these files as your own for any course work. While I'm happy to be contacted with questions on labs, do not commit academic misconduct.
